# CCDC
Algorithm developed for Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) of land cover using all available Landsat data.
Please contact Zhe Zhu (zhe.zhu@ttu.edu) at Department of Geosciences, Texas Tech University if you have any questions.

The Most Recent 13.01 CCDC Software for Change Detection software is here. It would work both for Analysis Ready Data and Collection 1 data. It would only work for 64 bits Linux machine.

CCDC Assistor 1.0 beta is also available at here, which is a user interface tool for assisting in data preparation and map extraction for CCDC (more functions are on the way).
